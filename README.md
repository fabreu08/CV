## 🔬 About Me

I am a **Master's-level Scientist** and **Compliance Lead** with over a decade of experience bridging the gap between complex wet chemistry and strict regulatory frameworks.

My career is defined by a commitment to rigorous **Data Integrity (ALCOA+)** and process defensibility. I specialize in high-volume laboratory operations, ensuring audit-readiness through strict adherence to **EPA, NELAC, USP, and cGMP** standards.

Unlike traditional scientists, I possess a strong background in **IT and Systems Architecture**, allowing me to optimize LIMS workflows, troubleshoot instrument networking, and integrate automation into Quality Control environments.
